                During Sprint0 we will read the text provided by the client, <b>analyzing</b> the requirements that the final product needs to fulfill.
                Our task is to comprehend and <b>formalize</b> those requirements, so that everyone (team members and the customer/product owner) agrees on their meaning.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In particular, the <a href="resources/userDocs/requirement_analysis.html">requirement analysis</a> aims to identify the actual requirements and the functionalities/features the product will need to include.
                Therefore, we are going to formalize the requirements specifically stated by the customer, or clarified through questions/interactions, which means they do not present ambiguities or alternatives of definition.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                On the other hand, the <a href="resources/userDocs/problem_analysis.html">problem analysis</a> purpose is to express what we came up with, while trying to remove those ambiguities, and the reasonings and arguments that led us to a particular decision rather than another one.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                As a consequence, the product of the analysis is going to be <i>models</i> (expressed in a particular modeling language), <i>diagrams</i> representing architectures and/or behaviours, and the related (executable) <i>test plans</i>.
                Then, from these, we will be able to draft some <a href="resources/userDocs/conclusions.html">conclusions</a> and define a work plan and the goal for the next Sprint: the Sprint1.
