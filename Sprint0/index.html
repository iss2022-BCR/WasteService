            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div>
                During Sprint0 we will read the text provided by the client, <b>analyzing</b> the requirements that the final product needs to fulfill.
                Our task is to comprehend and <b>formalize</b> those requirements with a programming language or with models, so that everyone
                (team members and the customer/product owner) agrees on their meaning.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In particular, the <a href="resources/userDocs/requirement_analysis.html">requirement analysis</a> aims to identify the actual requirements and the functionalities/features the product will need to include.
                Therefore, we are going to formalize the requirements specifically stated by the customer, or clarified through questions/interactions, which means they do not present ambiguities or alternatives of definition.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                On the other hand, the <a href="resources/userDocs/problem_analysis.html">problem analysis</a> purpose is to express what we came up with, while trying to remove those ambiguities, and the reasonings and arguments that led us to a particular decision rather than another one.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                As a consequence, the product of the analysis (for the next Sprints, but eventually already from this one) is going to be:
                a detailed formalization of the requirements, grouped by functionality, and eventually some model.
                <ul>
                    <li><i>models</i> (expressed in a particular modeling language);</li>
                    <li><i>diagrams</i> representing architectures and/or behaviours;</li>
                    <li>and the related (executable) <i>test plans</i>.</li>
                </ul>
                Then, from these, we will be able to draft some <a href="resources/userDocs/conclusions.html">conclusions</a> and define a work plan and the goal for the next Sprint: the Sprint1.

            <h2>Motto</h2>
            <div class="remark">
                There is no code without a project, there is no project without problem analysis, there is no problem without requirements.
            </div>
