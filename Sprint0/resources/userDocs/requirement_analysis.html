            <h2 id="General-Overview">General Overview</h2>
            From the analysis of text provided by the customer, we are able to draft one
            main evidence: the software system is going to comprehend at least 3 computational
            nodes:
            <ul>
                <li>WasteService node</li>
                <li>Alarm-warning node</li>
                <li>Monitoring node</li>
            </ul>
            However, since the WasteService software doesn't run on the transport trolley
            machine, it must comunicate with it. So we're going to consider an ulterior one:
            the transport trolley node, which task is to drive the robot, according to the WasteService
            "orders".
