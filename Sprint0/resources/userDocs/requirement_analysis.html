            Scopo finale del prodotto: gestire un servizio di smaltimento di rifiuti di diverso tipo.
            Come prima cosa, iniziamo analizzando i requisiti introdotti dal committente, ordinati per priorità:
            <ol>

            </ol>
            <br/>
            Motivazione della priorità e discussione (tutti concordano?)

            <br/>
            Ora formalizziamo tali requisiti creando un dizionario di riferimento.

            Entità emerse durante l'analisi dei requisiti (e come potrebbero essere modellate):
            <ul>
                <li>service area software</li>
                <li></li>

            Modelli vari e diagrammi (nell'analisi del problema!!!): 1 disegno dell'architettura generale nel suo insieme(?);
            diagrammi UML generici.

            Scelta del linguaggio di modellazione (Qak) CON MOTIVAZIONE!!!
            <br/>
            Una buona motivazione è che è un linguaggio completo (in quanto include Kotlin), e permette di specificare il concetto di richiesta e risposta. Inoltre aggiungere anche un link alla documentazione
