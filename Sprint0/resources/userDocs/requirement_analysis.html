            The purpose of the final product is to <b>manage a waste-disposal service</b>.
            
            <h2 id="Customer-Clarifications">Customer Clarifications</h2>
            The interaction with the customer pointed out the following clarifications:
            <ul>
                <li>Waste truck driver is a human operator external to the system.</li>
                <li>
                    The messages sent by the truck driver through a smart device are however 
                    part of the system
                </li>
                <li>The waste truck should be dismissed as soon as possible.</li>
                <li>
                    WasteService might receive a new request while it's still processing the
                    deposit action of the previous one.
                </li>
                <li>Once full, containers aren't emptied until the application is restarted.</li>
                <li>
                    The trolley position could be represented as qualitative indications,
                    for example "at indoor", "at glassbox", etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The robot is not required to move optimally, but it shouldn't wander around
                    the room too much either.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The collection time of the material from the truck is always limited and predictable, 
                    while the time required for storage could be quite long (also due to the not-optimal movement).
                </li>
                <li>Sonar and led are NOT on the trolley, but on a separate Raspberry Pi.</li>
                <li>The sonar detects objects that we place in front of it.</li>
                <li>The trolley stop, as a consequence of an "alarm" from the Sonar, should occur "as soon as possible".</li>
                <li>
                    The DDR provided by the customer has an on-board sonar, but this is used
                    to detect obstacles when the robot is moving (e.g. the room walls).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="System-Abstract">System Abstract</h3>
            From the analysis of text provided by the customer, we are able to draft one
            main evidence: the software system is going to comprehend at least 4 computational
            nodes:
            <ul>
                <li>WasteService node</li>
                <li>Smart device (waste truck) node</li>
                <li>Alarm-warning node</li>
                <li>Monitoring node</li>
            </ul>
            However, since the WasteService software doesn't run on the robot
            machine, it must comunicate with it. Therefore we're going to consider an ulterior one:
            the DDR robot node, which task is to drive the robot, according to the TransportTrolley
            "orders".

            <h4 id="Service-Area">Service Area</h4>
            Given the description and the image provided by the customer, we've modeled the service area as
            a rectangle free from obstacles and surrounded by 4 walls, within which there are 4 relevant areas:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>HOME</b>, an area of the same size as the transport trolley, in which it will be placed
                    each time the WasteService software is run;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>INDOOR</b>, a zone along the perimeter, where the transport trolley will have to go
                    every time the WasteService receives a StoreRequest, and from which it will pick up the waste;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>GLASSBOX</b> and <b>PLASTICBOX</b>, an area along the perimeter, where the transport trolley 
                    will have to deposit the respective waste.
                </li>
            </ul>
            The transport trolley is considered "at HOME" when it is above the HOME area, while it is considered
            "at INDOOR", "at GLASSBOX" or "at PLASTICBOX", when it hits the wall of that area.

            <b>Problem</b>: we need to fill the abstraction gap related to the concept of <i>service</i>.<br/>
            <b>Solution</b>: <ksi>QAK meta-modeling language</ksi>.<br/>
            <b>Reasons</b>:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It's was entirely implemented whitin our
                    <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2022">software house</a>, which makes
                    it easier to get information and support from the actual creator of the language. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    It provides a way to represent concepts related to services, such as
                    request, response, dispatch, etc.; while other general-purpose languages
                    would need external libraries (e.g. Java would need some kind of JAR to
                    implement Actors), frameworks or resources to do the same.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It allows you to create executable models, directly from the language,
                    which capture the salient aspects of the requirements or problems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Our software house already has some project and components we could
                    exploit and use.
                </li>
