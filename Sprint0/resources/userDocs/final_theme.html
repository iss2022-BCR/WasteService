            <div class>
                A company intends to build a <ksi>WasteService</ksi> for the <i>separate collection of waste</i>, composed of a set of elements:
                <ol>
                    <li>a service area (rectangular, flat) that includes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>an <ksi>INDOOR</ksi> port, to enter waste material</li>
                            <li>a <ksi>PlasticBox</ksi> container, devoted to store objects made of plastic, up to <b>MAXPB</b> kg of material.</li>
                            <li>a <ksi>GlassBox</ksi> container, devoted to store objects made of glass, up to <b>MAXGB</b> kg of material.</li>
                        </ul>
                        The service area is free from internal obstacles, as shown in the following picture:<br/>
                        <center><img width="70%" src="../../../commons/temaFinale/_images/WasteServiceRoom.PNG"/></center>
                    </li>
                    <li>a DDR robot working as a <ksi>transport trolley</ksi>, that is initially situated in its <ksi>HOME</ksi> location. The transport trolley has the form of a square of side length <b>RD</b>.
                        <br><br>
                        The <i>transport trolley</i> is used to perform a <ksi>deposit action</ksi> that consists in the following phases:
                        <ol>
                            <li>pick up a waste-load from a <ksi>Waste truck</ksi> located on the <i>INDOOR</i></li>
                            <li>go from the <i>INDOOR</i> to the proper waste container</li>
                            <li>deposit the waste-load in the container</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>a <ksi>Service-manager</ksi> (a human being) which supervises the state of the service-area by using a <ksi>WasteServiceStatusGUI</ksi>.</li>
                    <li>a <ksi>Sonar</ksi> and a <ksi>Led</ksi> connected to a RaspberryPi. The Led is used as a warning device, according to the following scheme:
                        <ul>
                            <li>the <i>Led</i> is <b>off</b> when the <i>transport trolley</i> is at HOME</li>
                            <li>the <i>Led</i> <b>blinks</b> while the <i>transport trolley</i> is moving</li>
                            <li>the <i>Led</i> is <b>on</b> when the <i>transport trolley</i> is stopped.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                The <i>Sonar</i> is used as an ‘alarm device’: when it measures a distance less than a prefixed value <b>DLIMT</b>, the <i>transport
                trolley</i> must be stopped. It will be resumed when <i>Sonar</i> detects again a distance higher than <b>DLIMT</b>.
                <br>
                <br>

                <h3 id="TFRequirements">TFRequirements</h3>
                The main goal of the <ksi>WasteService</ksi> software is to allow a <ksi>Waste truck</ksi> to deposit its load of <b>TruckLoad</b> kg plastic or glass in the proper container.
                <br><br>
                The global story can be described as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>The <i>Waste truck</i> driver approaches the <i>INDOOR</i> and sends (using a smart device) a request to store the load, by specifying the <i>type of the material</i> (plastic or glass) and its <i>TruckLoad</i>.</li>
                    <li>The <i>WasteService</i> sends the answer <i>loadaccept</i> if the final content of proper container will not surpass the maximum value allowed (<i>MAXPB</i> or <i>MAXGB</i>). Otherwise, it sends the answer <i>loadrejecetd</i> and the <i>Waste truck</i> leaves the <i>INDOOR</i> area.</li>
                    <li>When the load is accepted, the <i>transport trolley</i> reaches the <i>INDOOR</i>, picks up the material, goes to the proper container and settles the material. During this activity, the <i>WasteService</i> <b>blinks</b> the <i>Led</i></li>
                    <li>When the deposit action is terminated, the <i>transport trolley</i> excutes another deposit command (if any) or returns to its <i>HOME</i>.</li>
                </ol>
                The <i>WasteService</i> must create a <ksi>WasteServiceStatusGUI</ksi> that shows to the <i>Service-manager</i>:
                <ul>
                    <li>the current state of the <i>transport trolley</i> and it position in the room</li>
                    <li>the current weight of the material stored in the two waste-containers</li>
                    <li>the current state of the <i>Led</i></li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3 id="Non-functional-requirements">Non functional requirements</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The ideal work team is composed of 3 members. Teams of 1 or 2 people (<ksi>NOT 4 or more</ksi>) are also allowed.</li>
                    <li>The team must present a work plan as the result of the requirements/problem analysis, including some significant TestPlan.</li>
                    <li>The team must present the sequence of SPRINT performed, with appropriate motivations.</li>
                    <li>Each SPRINT must be associated with its own ‘chronicle’ (see <a href="templateToFill.html">templateToFill.html</a>) that presents, in concise way, the key-points related to each phase of development.
                        Hopefully, the team could also deploy the system using Docker.</li>
                    <li>Each team must publish and maintain a <ksi>GIT-repository</ksi> (referred in the <a href="">templateToFill.html</a>) with the code and the related documents.</li>
                    <li>The team must present (in synthetic, schematic way) the <ksi>specific activity</ksi> of each team-component.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 id="Guidelines">Guidelines</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The number and purpose of SPRINT are defined by the development Team after appropriate interactions with the customer.</li>
                    <li>The customer (and/or the product-owner) is available ONLINE every <ksi>Thursday from 16 to 18</ksi> until <ksi>21st of June 2022</ksi>, but is always reachable on-demand via e-mail.</li>
                </ul>

                The work must be carried out in several phases:
                <ol>
                    <li>The <ksi>analysis phase</ksi>, which ends with the definition of a logical architecture of the system, executable models and some significant test plans.
                        It's recommended that the results of this phase are presented to the customer (on appointment), before the final delivery of the product.</li>
                    <li>The <ksi>project and production phase</ksi>, which ends with the deployment of the product.</li>
                    <li>The <ksi>discussion phase</ksi> of the work that had been carried out, which will have to take place IN PRESENCE, (preferably) in Lab2.</li>
                </ol>
                It is advisable that each participant is ready to discuss also the works that they developed during the course.

                <h3 id="Interview-PHASES">Interview PHASES</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Group presentation of the system <ksi>‘live’ demo</ksi>, which must not exceed 15 minutes.
                        The group presentation order will be scheduled by the teacher.
                        The demo must show the execution of <ksi>at least one automated Test(Plan)</ksi>, that has been evaluated as significant by the group.
                        For applications which do NOT use real robots video presentations are NOT allowed.</li>
                    <li>Group presentation of the system project and its report with the analysis phase.
                        In this phase the teacher <ksi>requires the preparation</ksi> of <prec>2-3 illustrative SLIDES</prec> about the architectures, with pictures and (if considered useful) references to the source code.
                        At the end of those phases, each group member can reach a maximum score of <prec>27/30</prec>.</li>
                    <li><ksi>Questions</ksi> (for examples, check the file <a href="">domande.html</a>) that the teacher addresses to single students, related to the product, the project and requirement/problem analysis.
                        At the end of this phase, a student can reach a maximum score of <prec>29/30</prec>.</li>
                    <li><ksi>Further questions</ksi> to single students.
                        At the end of this phase, a student can reach a score of <prec>30L</prec>.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3 id="Software-Updates">Software Updates</h3>
                The teacher published the following resources on the course GIT:
                <ul>
                    <li>the project <i>unibo.comm22</i> with various implementations of <i>Interaction2021</i> with different protocols.</li>
                    <li>the project <i>webrobot22</i> (and the file <i>webRobot22.html</i> in the material folders) which provides a webGUI for the basicrobot.</li>
                    <li>the project <i>unibo.testqakexample</i> as a JUnit example for the testing of the <i>pickup</i> request from the final theme, based on a qak model and based on the fact that qak actors are CoAP resources.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="Customer-Clarifications">Customer Clarifications</h3>
                Next are reported the answers given by the customer to some specific questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>It's better to dismiss the truck as soon as possible.</li>
                    <li>The <i>WasteService</i> might receive a new request while it's still processing the deposit action of the previous one.</li>
                    <li>Once full, the containers won't get emptied, if not by restarting the application.</li>
                    <li>As for the <i>trolley position</i>, even qualitative indications are valid, such as ‘at indoor’, ‘at glassbox’, etc.</li>
                    <li>The robot is not required to move in an optimized way, but it shouldn't even wander too much around the room.</li>
                    <li>The pick-up time of the material from the truck is always limited and predictable, while the time needed for the storage could even be quite long (related to the previous point).</li>
                    <li>Sonar/led are NOT on top of the trolley, but on a separated RaspberryPi.</li>
                    <li>The Sonar detects objects which we are going to position in front of it.</li>
                    <li>The DDR provided by the customer is equipped with an on-board sonar which is used to detect obstacles while it's moving.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 id="Notes-following-the-online-interactions">Notes following the online interactions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The purpose of the final theme is NOT (only) to solve the problem, but rather to reason on the software building process of a particular case study.</li>
                    <li>The requirement analysis purpose is to redefine the text given by the customer in a ‘precise’ (and formal, which to us means understandable by the machine) way.
                        About the different entities specified in the text, it's needed to answer some specific questions, such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>what does the customer mean with xxx (e.g. DDR robot)?</li>
                            <li>does the customer provide details regarding the software to be used for xxx?</li>
                            <li>if so, is it possible to provide a model of that software (to better understand what we need to use it)?</li>
                        </ul>
                        It is also necessary to pay close attention to sentences written in natural language and to give them an unambiguous interpretation. For example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>for the phrase <i>a DDR robot working as a transport trolley</i>, what relationship do you think should exist between the <i>trolley</i> entity and the <i>DDR robot</i> entity?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Each phrase (starting from the requirements) should end with the specification of a model (even not executable) which constituted the beginning of the following phrase.</li>
                    <li>The HTML files in <i>userDocs</i> must not be imagined as ‘documentation’, but rather as a sort of ‘captain's diary’ which notes (synthetically, in natural language) the essential points that led to those models.</li>
                    <li>The use of the <b>qak</b> language must be motivated in relation to the characteristics of the (sub)problem examined and introduced with a <highlight1>link to a document that explains what it is</highlight1>.
                        That document should be written - once only - by those who propose its use (with links to ‘official’ documents), in order to highlight why it is proposed, in the context of the problem (it's also a way to ‘review’ what has been done during the course).</li>
                    <li>Each model should be coupled with at least one significant functional TestPlan.</li>
                    <li>The purpose of the analysis phases is to define a (executable) model of the logical architecture and to provide useful elements for the construction of a <i>work plan</i>.</li>
                    <li>The first SPRINT (Sprint1) should arise from the work plan and start from the analysis model.</li>
                    <li>Each SPRINT should:
                        <ul>
                            <li>be associated with a specific goal (SCRUM goal)</li>
                            <li>deepen the analysis related to the sub-problem of the SPRINT goal</li>
                            <li>extend/refine the logical architecture and the TestPlan</li>
                            <li>define a project architecture and the related Tests.</li>
                            <li>end with an executable prototype (to be discussed with the client) and a suggestion for a new SPRINT (which could also consist of a revision of the analysis, if something was done wrong)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Each SPRINT should end with a summary page showing the final architecture of the system (with links to the model and the tests). This page will be the beginning of the document relating to the next SPRINT.</li>
