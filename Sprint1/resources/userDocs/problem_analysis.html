            <b>Problem</b>: implementation of an application to test the interaction between the truck driver and the waste service.<br/>
            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>: <ksi>Flutter application</ksi>.<br/>
                <b>Reasons</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Google framework released recently (end of 2018) and with great and active support.</li>
                    <li>Based on Dart language (also developed by Google), an object-oriented language with a syntax much similiar to Java.</li>
                    <li>
                        Simple to use and learn, since the documentation is full of examples and tutorials,
                        which makes it easier to develop prototypes and production applications, and it's becoming
                        more and more popular lately.
                    </li>
                    <li>Material design: everything is a Widget, which make it perfect when it comes to apply OOP principles and design patterns.</li>
                    <li>Cross-platform: it allows to write one codebase and build it for many platforms (web, desktop, <b><i>mobile</i></b>).</li>
                    <li>Hot reload allows to see changes directly while using the application, without having to rebuild it entirely.</li>
                    <li>
                        Extremely handy: we can show off a <i>more practical demo</i> to the customer, since we can give him
                        an application that he can <b><i>install and try directly on his smartphone</i></b>.

            The customer requirements don't specify priority rules regarding the truck requrests,
            therefore, they'll be served in order of arrival.

            We decide to send a <code>load_rejected</code> even if the <code>store_request</code>
            contains a invalid data:
            <ul>
                <li>Not properly formatted according to the JSON object.</li>
                <li>Negative or too big WasteLoad.</li>
                <li>WasteType not present in the Service Area.</li>
            </ul>   

            <problem>Service Area Representation</problem>
            <b>Problem</b>: we need a proper <i>representation</i> of the service area to optimally move and monitor the transport trolley.
            <br/>
            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Waste Service side: use a descriptive model to indicate the main relevant position (<red>HOME</red>, <cyan>INDOOR</cyan>, <green>GLASSBOX</green>, <yellow>PLASTICBOX</yellow>).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transport Trolley side: Use a <ksi>2x2 matrix</ksi>, where each element represents a different position, starting from the top-left corner.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <b>Reasons</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Since the HOME is the top-left corner, it's more intuitive to represent it as the
                        first element of the matrix, which is the [0,0] element. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We can associate a <b>cartesian coordinate system</b> to the matrix with the origin in the
                        top-left corner and RD as unit. That might make things <i>easier later on</i>, if we will
                        need to implement a graphical representation of the transport trolley state 
                        (for example in WasteServiceStatusGUI).
                        This because almost every software, library, framework or API, start drawing from
                        the top-left corner to the bottom-right one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <highlight2>We could use the software provided by the customer,
                        such as the mapper to obtain a representation of the room,
                        and the path executor to make the robot move along a path.</highlight2>

            The matrix number of rows and columns depend on RD (which is the size of the DDR robot),

            We assume that the deposit action cannot fail and the trolley cannot be stopped, for the moment.
            However, since we know in the next sprint we'll implement the stop/resume mechanics, we decide to model the interaction in an asynchronous way.

            <problem>Waste Types</problem>
            <b>Problem</b>: how does the smart device know which types of waste can be dumped to the waste service?
            <br/>
            <b>Possible solution</b>: hard-code the types into the Smart Device.
            <br/>
            <b>Considerations</b>:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Pros</b>: this is the easiest solution to implement, since they can be just implemented as a list or an enumerative.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Cons</b>: not scalable, since it doesn't allow the Waste Service to have different waste containers but
                    the ones initially specified by the customer in the requirements.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <solution>
                <b>Better solution</b>: <ksi>ask the Waste Service for the allowed waste types</ksi>, along with the
                connection message, and update the Smart Device list to be chosen.
                <br/>
                <b>Reasons</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Much <b><i>more scalable</i></b>, since the list can eventually be extended in the future, all from the Waste Service side,
                        without having to distribute or push updates to the Smart Device. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It introduces a layer of complexity, since the communication between the Smart Device and the Waste Service requires
                        at least <b><i>one more message</i></b>, but the tradeoff gives more advantages than the disadvantages, and the result can be
                        achieved by introducing a specific Actor that deals with the types providing.

            <problem>Store Request Validation</problem>
            <b>Problem</b>: what happens if the user enter invalid parameters of a store request? What happens if the waste service receives an invalid store request?
            <br/>
            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <ksi>client-side validation</ksi>: if the user enters invalid parameters for the
                        store request, the Smart Device displays an error and the request cannot be sent.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ksi>server-side validation</ksi>: if an invalid store request is received, the Waste Service
                        replies with a loadrejected.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br/>
                <b>Reasons</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        That solution is the simplest to implement and the most efficient, since we invalid store
                        requests are just ignored, and the Waste Service doesn't spend computational time and resources
                        trying to understand the reason.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since nothing (at the current state of the project) prevents a malicious user
                        to create and utilize a fake application which allows him to send invalid store requests,
                        a server-side validation, would make it impossible to break the system or have unexpected behaviour.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </solution>
            <b>Eventual extra features</b>: having a security layer which allows only trusted devices to send store requests.
            This way, by knowing that the smart device will always be an original one (produced and deployed by our
            software house), we know for sure that a certain behaviour will be respected,
            therefore it won't be possible to send invalid store requests.
            
            <problem>Replies and Waste Truck Dismiss</problem>
            <b>Problem</b>: when is the reply sent and what message do we send? Do we introduce other messages apart from loadaccepted and loadrejected?
            How do we know immediately if the Waste Service can store the waste of a new request? How can we meet the requirement that
            the waste truck must be sent away as soon as possible?
            <br/>
            <b>Considerations</b>:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Waste Service might receive a new request while it is handling another one.
                </li>
                <li>The pickup action takes some time (a defined and known amount).</li>
                <li>
                    If the Smart Device sends a request while there is another deposit action
                    in progress, it must wait it to be completed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If we're able to know if the load can be deposited as soon as we receive the request,
                    we could reply instantly, and therefore meet the requirement that the truck driver must
                    be sent away <i>as soon as possible</i>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <solution>
                <b>Adopted solution</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Send the <ksi>loadaccepted</ksi> reply <ksi>when the Waste Service completes the pickup action</ksi>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use <ksi>2 separate storage counters</ksi>: one that is updated as soon as the store request
                        is managed (incremented in the case of the loadaccepted), and a second one,
                        which is the actual current state of the storage, that is updated only when the
                        transport trolley completes a deposit action.

                        Use <ksi>2 separate actors</ksi>: the Waste Service that handles the requests, and the Transport Trolley
                        that performs the deposit actions.

                <b>Reasons</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Send a reply only when the truck driver can be sent away.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It's simple to implement, since there are less messages to deal with, therefore less overhead.

                        Using <i>2 separate storage counters</i> allows us to send a reply to the
                        Smart Device as soon as possible, since we know if the waste can be stored at any time.
                    </li>

                <b>Alternative (better) solution</b>: introduce <i>one more message</i> '<code>pickup_completed</code>', that is sent by the Waste Service to
                the Smart Device and indicates that the pickup of the waste has been completed and the waste truck can leave the indoor.
                <br/>
                <b>Difficulties</b>: the QAK currently doesn't provide a way to send dispatches to aliens (i.e. the Smart Device), therefore we are not able to notify the Smart Device when the corresponding pickup action has been completed.
            </alternative>
            <b>Eventual extra features</b>:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Send notification messages about the state (for example, 
                    'there is another deposit action in progress', or 'pickup action in progress')
                </li>
                <li>Send an estimate of the time to wait before the pickup (we might calculate the time of the previous requests)</li>
                <li>Allow the Smart Device to cancel a queued request.</li>
            </ul>
