            <h1 align="center">Project</h1>
            The project contains all the software our team developed for the core-business of the project.
            We divided our work in <b>3 sub-sprint</b>, one for each block of software we implemented:
            <ol>
                <li><a href="#SmartDevice-Simulator">Sprint 1.1</a> SmartDevice Simulator & Echo Waste Server</li>
                <li><a href="#Map-Editor">Sprint 1.2</a> Map Editor</li>
                <li><a href="#Waste-Service">Sprint 1.3</a> Waste Service</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="Logical-Architecture">Logical Architecture</h2>
            The main change in the logical architecture from the Problem Analysis is the context
            specialization: during the project phase we modeled the system by using:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    one <ksi>context for the waste service business logic</ksi> (accepting and processing
                    of the requests and updating of the storage status);
                </li>
                <li>
                    one <ksi>context for the execution of the real deposit operations</ksi> (performed by the
                    transport trolley) which is transparent to the user (truck diver).
                </li>
            </ul>
            The smart device is actually an <i>alien</i>, since it's not a real QAK actor, but we included it
            in the model for demonstrative purposes, because it helps to have a general idea of how the system works,
            and it also served as a test support.

            <h2 id="SmartDevice-Simulator">Sprint 1.1: SmartDevice Simulator</h2>
            <ksi>SmartDevice Simulator</ksi> (<a href="../../Sprint1_Project/sprint1_smart_device/">sprint1_smart_device</a>) is a mobile/desktop compatible application,
            which will be used to simulate the arrival of the TruckDriver to the service area,
            and simulate its interaction with the WasteService:
            it allows to send <i>store requests</i>, and display the response.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            It has been made using Flutter, which is a Google framework to build applications which can be
            built for different architectures.
            
            <center><a href="https://flutter.dev/"><img width="90%" alt="Flutter: Build apps for any screen." title="Flutter: Build apps for any screen." src="../imgs/Flutter2.png"/></a>
                <br/>
                <b><i>Flutter: Build apps for any screen</i>.</b>
            </center>
            <br/>
            It presents 2 view:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <ks>ViewHome</ks>: shows 2 input fields to enter the IP address and port of the server
                    (the WasteService) and a button to try to connect. If the connection succeeds, the application
                    will show the <i>ViewRequest</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ks>ViewRequest</ks>: as soon as that view is built, it sends a TypesRequest to the WasteService,
                    to know which waste types can be deposited in the service area. Once those types are obtained,
                    a drop down menu will be displayed, to allow the user to choose the Waste Type. There is also another
                    input field for the Waste Weight. Once the user press the "Send Store Request" button, a StoreRequest
                    is sent to the WasteService, and the application displays a waiting message and greys the button, to
                    prevent the user from spamming requests. When the reply is retrieved, the view shows a message, informing
                    the user if the load has been accepted and picked up or not.
                </li>
            </ul>
            All the input fields are supplied together with a <b><i>validation mechanism</i></b>, which prevents the user from sending
            invalid messages.

            <h2 id="Echo-Waste-Server">Sprint 1.1: Echo Waste Server</h2>
            <ksi>Echo Waste Server</ksi> (<a href="../../Sprint1_Project/sprint1_echo_waste_server/">sprint1_echo_waste_server</a>)
            is a mobile/desktop application that simulates a dummy WasteService and acts like an "enhanced" echo server:
            it accepts TCP connections and reply to <code>store_requests</code> with <code>load_accepted</code> / <code>load_rejected</code>,
            updating the capacity of containers and logging messages.
            <br/><br/>
            It doesn't contribute to the WasteService project in any way, and its main purpose was to <i>test the SmartDevice directly and
            completely on smartphone</i>, without having to connect it to another device.
            But since we had already developed it, we decided to include it in the project section. 
            <h4>Demo</h4>
            <img width="100%" src="../imgs/project/EchoWasteServer_v2.png"/>

            <h2 id="Map-Editor">Sprint 1.2: Map Editor</h2>
            <ksi>MapEditorBCR</ksi> (<a href="../../Sprint1_Project/sprint1_map_editor/">sprint1_map_editor</a>) is a graphical desktop application that allows the user to
            configure the room, by the assignment of a <b>type</b>/<b>label</b> to each cell of the map.
            
            <h4>Demo</h4>
            <img width="49%" src="../imgs/project/MapEditor1.png"><img width="49%" src="../imgs/project/MapEditor2.png">
            <br/><br/>
            The MapConfiguration consists of a Java object
            (<a href="../../Sprint1_Project/sprint1_map_editor/src/main/java/it/unibo/map_editor_bcr/model/map_config/MapConfig.java">MapConfig</a>) which is built starting
            from a RoomMap (defined in <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2022/blob/main/unibo.planner22">unibo.planner22</a>): they have the same dimensions.
            That configuration can be saved as a binary file to be loaded and used by the WasteService planner afterwards, to generate a path towards those locations.
            
            <pre>
                |H, -, -, -, G, G, G, 
                |-, -, -, -, -, -, -,

                |I, I, I, -, -, -, P, 
            </pre>

            The <b>main aspects</b> of the Map Editor are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It's <ksi>easy to use</ksi>: while writing the coordinate one by one is wasteful
                    and error prone, dragging the already labeled cell in the exact position of the map
                    is a way simpler and less painful way to configure the room.
                    Moreover, this helps the user to realize how the cell are actually arranged inside the room
                    since it displays the graphical representation of the map layout.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improves <ksi>transparency</ksi> by hiding what the user doesn't necessarily need to see
                    (the coordinate system).
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's a <ksi>flexible</ksi> way of configuring the Service Area, since the cell types can be
                    easily extended with new types (the application already provides some extra types not requested
                    by the customer, as an example, such as "ORGANIC", "METAL", etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's shipped with some <ksi>pretty feature</ksi>, such as: different edit modes (add, remove, move and swap);
                    possibility to hide/show the base room map, the map configuration, and even the coordinate systems;
                    possibility to display the history of actions performed by the user; possibility to undo/redo actions,
                    implemented through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern">Command Pattern</a>; editable
                    settings, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">Singleton Pattern</a>, and
                    persistent (saved using a JSON file, and parsed with <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson">Gson</a>
                    library).

            is the heart of the project. It's the main element of the core-business but also the main element of the whole
            distributed system: it receives requests from smart devices and handles the interactions with other components,
            such as (in the current Sprint) the TransportTrolley.

            <h3 id="wasteservice-WasteService">WasteService</h3>
            <ksi>wasteservice.WasteService</ksi> is a Kotlin class used to store information about the service:
            it contains 3 maps of type <code>EnumMap&lt;WasteType, Double&gt;</code> that represent an amount of KG
            for each WasteType of the service:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <ks><code>preStorage</code></ks> - is updated as soon as the TransportTrolley starts processing a deposit request.
                    This way we can instantly reply with a negative answer (loadRejected) if a certain amount of waste cannot be stored
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ks><code>storage</code></ks> - is updated when the deposit is completed (it represents
                    the actual current state of the containers).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ks><code>storageCapacity</code></ks> - is the max amount of waste that each container can store.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Aswell as the maps, the class contains methods to get and update the values of the containers, which are used
            by the QAK actor of the WasteService.

            <h3 id="wasteservice-Utils">Utils</h3>
            <ksi>wasteservice.Utils</ksi> is a Kotlin object that contains utility methods, for example to parse and validate the waste types,
            or to simulate an action:
            <ul>
                <li><ks><code>simulateAction(Double)</code></ks> takes an amount of waste and simulate an action, 
                for example the pickup or deposit, by waiting for an amount of time which is proportional to it. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="Planner-BCR">PlannerBCR</h3>
            <ksi>PlannerBCR</ksi> is an <i>extension</i> of the Planner22Util Kotlin object, provided by our software house.
            We added the <b>support for the map configuration</b>, by exposing some new static methods:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <ks><code>loadMapConfig(String)</code></ks> - loads a Java object of type <code>it.unibo.map_editor_bcr.model.map_config.MapConfig</code>.
                    That's the object containing the meaning of each room map cell.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ks><code>showMapConfig()</code></ks> - prints the map configuration as a legacy string (same format of the RoomMap).
                    <pre>
                        |H, -, -, -, G, G, G, 
                        |-, -, -, -, -, -, -, 
                        |-, -, -, -, -, -, P, 
                        |-, -, -, -, -, -, P, 
                        |I, I, I, -, -, -, P,                         
                    </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ks><code>showFancyMapConfig()</code></ks> - prints the map configuration as a slightly prettier string.
<pre style="white-space: pre;">

                    <ks><code>getNearestPositionToCellType(Pair&lt;Int, Int&gt;, String): Pair&lt;Int, Int&gt;</code></ks> - 
                    return the coordinate (<code>Pair&lt;Int, Int&gt;</code>) of the nearest <code>CellType</code> starting from a given coordinate.
                    The <code>CellType</code> is the label associated with a cell (e.g. "HOME", "GLASS", etc.).
                </li>
            </ul>
            In order to use PlannerBCR, we need to add the <ksi>map_editor_bcr</ksi> JAR dependency in the <code>build.gradle</code> file:

            <h3 id="WEnv">Virtual Environment (WEnv)</h3>
            Our software house provided the software to virtually simulate the robot inside the room, in the form
            of a <a href="../../../unibo.basicrobot22/virtualRobotOnly4.0.yaml">docker image</a>.
            <br/>
            To run it simply enter the following command, after moving to its directory (<a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> needed):
            <pre>
                docker-compose -f .\virtualRobotOnly4.0.yaml up
            </pre>
            NB: we use the image with only the virtual robot, because our basic robot (which is needed for the simulation to work,
            is a QAK actor).

            <h3 id="Run-WasteService-Contexts">Run WasteService Contexts</h3>
            To ease the debugging of the WasteService project, we created 3 gradle task, one for each context:
<pre style="white-space: pre;">
task(runCtx_WasteService, dependsOn: 'classes', type: JavaExec) {
    mainClass = 'it.unibo.ctx_wasteservice.MainCtx_wasteserviceKt'
    classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
}

task(runCtx_TransportTrolley, dependsOn: 'classes', type: JavaExec) {
    mainClass = 'it.unibo.ctx_transporttrolley.MainCtx_transporttrolleyKt'
    classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
}

task(runCtx_Robot, dependsOn: 'classes', type: JavaExec) {
    mainClass = 'it.unibo.ctx_robot.MainCtx_robotKt'
    classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
}
</pre>

            Those tasks allow us to run each context using a specific, separate gradle demon,
            with the following commands:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Run the <ks>Robot</ks> context:
                    <pre>
                        ./gradlew runCtx_Robot
                    </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run the <ks>TransportTrolley</ks> context:
                    <pre>
                        ./gradlew runCtx_TransportTrolley
                    </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run the <ks>WasteService</ks> context:
                    <pre>
                        ./gradlew runCtx_WasteService
                    </pre>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="Build-WasteService">Build WasteService</h3>
            In order to produce a self-contained JAR for each context, we added the following entries
            in the <a href="../../Sprint1_Project/sprint1_waste_service/build.gradle"><code>build.gradle</code></a> file:

<pre style="white-space: pre;">
application {
    // Define the main class for the application: -P&lt;build_name&gt; (default: WasteService build)
    mainClassName = 'it.unibo.ctx_wasteservice.MainCtx_wasteserviceKt'
    if (project.hasProperty("build_TransportTrolley")) {
        mainClassName = 'it.unibo.ctx_wasteservice.MainCtx_transporttrolleyKt'
    } else if (project.hasProperty("build_Robot")) {
        mainClassName = 'it.unibo.ctx_wasteservice.MainCtx_robotKt'
    }
}

jar {
    from sourceSets.main.allSource
    println("building $mainClassName jar...")
    manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class': "$mainClassName"
    }
    baseName = project.findProperty('mainClassName')
    duplicatesStrategy = DuplicatesStrategy.EXCLUDE
    from ((configurations.compileClasspath.findAll{ !it.path.endsWith(".pom") }).collect { it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it) }) {
        exclude 'META-INF/MANIFEST.MF'
        exclude 'META-INF/*.SF'
        exclude 'META-INF/*.DSA'
        exclude 'META-INF/*.RSA'
    }
}
</pre>
            To build the jar for a specific context, one must pass the correct parameter
            with the <code>-P</code> option:
            <ul>
                <li><b>(Default)</b> <ks><code>build_WasteService</code></ks>, to build the WasteService context;</li>
                <li><ks><code>build_TransportTrolley</code></ks>, to build the TransportTrolley context;</li>
                <li><ks><code>build_Robot</code></ks>, to build the Robot context.</li>
            </ul>
            The JAR gets then built and placed under <a href="../../Sprint1_Project/sprint1_waste_service/build/libs/">build/libs/</a>.

            Example:
            <pre>
                ./gradlew jar -Pbuild_TransportTrolley
            </pre>
            Will produce the JAR named: <code>it.unibo.ctx_transporttrolley.MainCtx_transporttrolleyKt-1.3.jar</code>

            <h2 id="Deployment">Deployment</h2>
            As a result of the project phase, we produced a series of applications, which
            can be downloaded from our <a href="https://github.com/iss2022-BCR/WasteService/releases/latest">GitHub repository</a>
            <ul>

                <li>WasteService: 3 self-containing JAR, one for each context (requires Java >8).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="WasteService-Demo">WasteService Demo</h2>
            In order to run demo components we need:
            <ul>
                <li>Java 8 or more recent</li>
                <li>Gradle 7.4.1 or more recent</li>

                <li>Flutter</li>
            </ul>

            The directory <a href="../../Sprint1_Project/scripts/">scripts/</a> contains batch scripts to run the sprint1 demo on Windows:

                            <b>NB</b>: in order to run the WasteService project, the dependencies must be resolved by having a folder named <code>unibolibs</code>, with the needed libraries
