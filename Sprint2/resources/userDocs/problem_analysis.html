            <problem><a href="../../../Sprint1/resources/userDocs/conclusions.html#Bugs">Bug #7</a>: LoarRejected Blocked</problem>
            <b>Problem</b>: If a Smart Device sends a store request when the Waste Service is already
            handling a deposit action, the request isn't consumed even if the load cannot be accepted
            (differently from what we've considered in Sprint1 Problem Analysis).
            <br/>
            <b>Consideration</b>: this occurs because the implementation is based on a request/response model:
                the message in the Waste Service queue cannot be consumed because the Waste Service itself is waiting 
                for the Transport Trolley reply, while it's performing a deposit action. That suggests us that
                the request/response model does not suit the interaction needed to meet the requirement that
                "the truck driver must be sent off as soon as possible".
            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>: use a <ksi>dispatch/dispatch interaction model</ksi> between the Waste Service and the Transport Trolley.
                <br/>
                <b>Reasons</b>: the dispatch/dispatch interaction allows the Waste Service <ksi>not to have to wait</ksi> for a
                reply from the Transport Trolley, which means it can handle other requests in the meantime.

                <b>Considerations</b>:
                <br/>
                This bug requires further investigations for us to understand how the Flutter framework translates and treats the Dart TCP sockets code.
            </consideration>

                Since that exceedes the objectives of our project and is a <i>minor issue</i> (given the fact that the user can still
                use and will probably prefer the Android version), we decide <ksi>not to solve it</ksi>, at least 
                for the moment. Therefore we opened an <a href="https://github.com/iss2022-BCR/WasteService/issues/11">issue</a> on the GitHub repository and added the "wontfix" label.

            <solution><b>Possible solution</b>:
                <br/>
                we could add one more SmartDevice-WasteService interaction before the store request:
                by introducing a <b>new actor</b>, the SmartDevice could ask if there is enough space for the deposit,
                and after getting the reply, if it's positive it would send a store request.
            </solution>
            <consideration>
                <b>Considerations</b>:
                this solution would work but it presents some issues:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There's a small window of time in which another SmartDevice could
                        send the store request "stealing" the priority for the deposit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The loadrejected reply to the storerequest would lose value,
                        since we know for sure that a storerequest can be sent only if
                        a SmartDevice knows there's enough space.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <b>Decision</b>:

                analyzing and/or implementing this issue, and therefore <ksi>not to solve it</ksi>:
                we stick with the solution we have already developed.

            The Sprint 2 software will be the product of the analysis of problems
            related to the Raspberry Pi.
            We will analyze the main problems of the <b><i>4th requirement</i></b>, and discuss the
            possible solutions and their differences.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <problem>Where to place the Raspberry Pi node</problem>
            If we think about a Raspberry Pi, we imagine it as a physical device, a unit with
            computing capabilities: a board with a CPU, memories, ports and an Internet connection.
            <br/>
            However, that doesn't necessarily mean that the Raspberry node needs to be a <b>real device</b>.
            In fact, the Raspberry might be <b>simulated</b> as well, for example to ease the testing
            of its software and the integration with the rest of the distributed system.
            <br/><br/>
            <b>Problem</b>: where will the Raspberry Pi software be placed and execute? How is it
            going to interact with the rest of the system, and with which components?
            
            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>: since the software related to the Raspberry Pi (and its business logic) will
                conceptually be separated from the Waste Service ones, we introduce a new context, which
                we're going to call "<ksi>ctx_raspberry</ksi>". The actors of this context will be running
                on the Raspberry Pi device in production, but could also be running in a simulation environment,
                for example on a Windows machine already hosting the WasteService software.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>NB</b>: the customer doesn't specify if the single components needs to be placed on the same
                device, but for the moment, for simplicity reasons we assume they will be (same node, same context).
            </solution>

            <h3 id="Software-Provided-by-the-Customer">Software Provided by the Customer</h3>
            <div class="remark">
                The customer provides the project <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2022/tree/main/it.unibo.radarSystem22.domain">it.unibo.radarSystem22.domain</a> 
                which implements a RadarSystem using concrete or simulated devices (Led/Sonar), implemented by following 
                software engineering principles and design patterns.
                <br/><br/>
                In particular, it exposes interfaces:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        for the <kc>Sonar</kc>
<pre style="white-space: pre;">
public interface ISonar extends IDevice{
    public void activate();		 
    public void deactivate();
    public IDistance getDistance();	
    public boolean isActive();
}
</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        for the <kc>Led</kc>
<pre style="white-space: pre;">
public interface ILed extends IDevice{
    public void turnOn();
    public void turnOff();
    public boolean getState();
}
</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        for the concept of the <kc>Distance</kc>
<pre style="white-space: pre;">
public interface IDistance {
    public int getVal();
    public String toString();
}
</pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The main choice made for the <code>radarSystem22.domain</code> project is that the
                different layers of abstraction (interfaces, the abstract classes <kc>SonarModel</kc>
                and <kc>LedModel</kc>, factories, ...) make it possible to separate components from
                their actual implementation, which could be whether real or virtual (simulated).
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In fact, what we are most interested in about this project, is the possibility to choose
                which implementation to use, through the configuration class <kc>DomainSystemConfig</kc>:
                that configuration can be loaded from a file, and that enables the project to be customizable
                even after the deployment phase.

            <h3 id="Sonar">Sonar</h3>
            What's the purpose of the sonar? Which components depend on it and where will
            them be located?
            <br/>
            NB: The sonar is an input alarm device, which is related to the stop/resume functionality.
            
            <problem>Get input from the component HC-SR04</problem>
            <b>Problem</b>: How do we obtain the input data from the sonar?
            Does the customer provide some software/project we could exploit?
            
            <consideration>
                <b>Consideration</b>:
                to use the HC-SR04 real component it must be attached to a power
                source and used properly follwing a sequence of actions. To do so,
                the customer provides the following software:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="../../Sprint2_ProblemAnalysis/resources/robotNano/SonarAlone.c">SonarAlone.c</a> - a small program which performs detections
                        each time interval (30ms);
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2022/tree/main/it.unibo.radarSystem22.domain">it.unibo.radarSystem22.domain</a>;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2022/tree/main/unibo.sonarqak22">unibo.sonarqak22</a> - a project which
                        uses different actors to obtain the sonar data from a simulated or concrete device, implemented using both coded actors
                        and QAK actors, and without exploiting the it.unibo.radarSystem22.domain functionalities.
                        <br/>
                        Moreover, this project make use of the "<b>Actors as streams</b>" feature of QAK, which allows the actors of a pipeline,
                        which are subscribed to the first one, to receive one after the other in cascade, local events (or, more in general,
                        messages). That feature could be extremely helpful in <b>reducing the traffic load</b>, since we don't know a priori
                        which will be the network capacity nor the bandwidth.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </consideration>

            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>: Exploit the project <ksi>it.unibo.radarSystem22.domain</ksi> and/or
                make changes to it to obtain a more suitable piece of software to be integrated in the
                system.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>Reasons</b>: the possibility to have simulated devices makes it easier to
                test the system without having to deploy on a real Raspberry Pi.
                The project already implements the features we need to satisfy the requirements,
                we just have to integrate it with the rest of the system.
                The project structure makes it easier to extend the project with additional
                features/functionalities.

            <problem>Sonar data sent</problem>
            <b>Problem</b>: What data does the sonar send to the other WasteService actors?
            Should it send a message for each detection?
            <alternative>
                <b>Possible solutions</b>:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Send a message <b>for each input data</b> detection. That solution
                        is the most flexible and general purpose to implement: we send everything
                        the sonar knows and let the Waste Service do the rest. However, that generates
                        an increase in bandwidth consumption, especially in the case the sonar performs
                        detections rapidly, and that could cause greater problems if
                        the service grows in size (<i>flexible but not much scalable</i>).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Send a message only <b>when the state changes</b>. That greatly reduces
                        the number of exchanged messages, saving bandwidth, and directly addresses the requirement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Hybrid approach</b> where we send every input data detection to a <b>middle component</b>,
                        which acts like a controller: it receives a sequence of distances, and mantains
                        the current state of the alarm (ON/OFF). Then, each time the state changes, propagate
                        a message to other contexts or to the actor which will detect the stop. The bandwidth
                        consumption depends on whether the sonar and the component are on the same or different nodes:
                        if the node is the same, then the only messages that are propagated are the ones on the state change.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </alternative>
            
            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>: Hybrid approach, using a <ksi>middle controller</ksi>, which sends 
                <code>stop</code> and <code>resume</code> events to the system.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>Reasons</b>: the core-business doesn't care about the distance at all.
                In fact, from the Waste Service perspective,
                the sonar acts as a simple switch ON/OFF, which indicates if the system
                is in a state of alarm (distance &lt; DLIM) or not. Therefore, the only information
                needed to completely address the customer requirement, is <ksi>the change of the "alarm"
                state</ksi> (the alarm just started &rarr; stop, the alarm is over &rarr; resume).
                Why using events for stop/resume? Because even though the Transport Trolley
                is the main actor interested in detecting the message, the alarm concerns the whole
                Service Area and has no specific recipient. That also makes the system more easily
                extendable with additional features.
            </solution>

                we want to <ksi>stop the movement</ksi> if the robot is still moving, while if it is stopped it cannot
                start moving until a resume event occurs; if it was already moving, it must stop
                in place and remain motionless.
            </solution>

            <!--Ideally we want to stop the robot doing things. However, the robot can be really
            stopped only when it wants to move from a position to another, because it won't.
            -->

            <problem>When to stop</problem>
            <b>Problem</b>: <i>"when"</i> do we stop the robot while it is moving?
            <br/>
            <b>Considerations</b>: our robot moves in steps in the area, since
            the room is represented as a M x N matrix.<br/>
            If we consider a real situation, the stop could be caused by an emergency
            or could be due to dangerous circumstances. Therefore, we would need to stop the
            robot instantly.
            <alternative>
                <b>Possible solution</b>: stop the robot <b>as soon as the stop/alarm message is received</b>.
                A possible solution could be save the duration of the interrupted
                step and calculate the remaining time to complete it (a full step is 350ms).
                <br/>
                <b>Cons</b>: those calculations based on execution time are never 100% accurate, due to
                many factors (CPU/resources, network latency, unpredictable jitter, etc.).
                Moreover, in case the step total duration gets shortened or extended, the whole map
                representation could be affected, and cause it not to be accurate anymore.
            </alternative>
            
            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>: for each step of the path, check if there is a stop/alarm event <ksi>only at the beginning or
                at the end of the step</ksi>.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>Reasons</b>: the robot position gets updated only when a step is completed,
                so it might be easier to make the steps not interruptible; since our map
                has specific positions, identified by discrete coordinates, that solution
                can prevent the possibility of the robot to be located in between two different
                cells, and also reduces the possibility to get an out of sync situation between
                the robot position inside the map representation and its actual real position.
            </solution>
            
            <problem>How to stop</problem>
            <b>Problem</b>: <i>"how"</i> do we stop the robot while it is moving? How do we enter
            in a stop state? How do we resume from the stopped state? Who should handle those states?
            
            <consideration>
                <b>Considerations</b>: a deposit action consists of a <ks><code>deposit</code></ks>
                request sent by the Waste Service to the Transport Trolley; then it sends a
                <ks><code>dopath</code></ks> request to the Path Executor; finally it sends the
                command/step to the Basic Robot.
            </consideration>
            
            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>: <ksi>handle the stop and resume from the pathexecutor</ksi> by adding a guard
                (<code>Transition t# whenEvent stop -> state_stop</code>) in those states that can be interrupted.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>Reasons</b>: ideally we want to act on the transport trolley, but it's busy waiting
                for the pathexecutor reply, until the path is completed. Therefore, since the pathexecutor
                is the one responsible for scheduling the steps, to interact with it is the best solution,
                also considering the fact that it's located in the Transport Trolley context, acting like an
                actuator for the trolley.
            </solution>
            NB: the defined solution requires that we will have to modify the pathexecutor QAK actor code, we are going to rename 
            it <i>"pathexecutorbcr"</i>.

            What's the purpose of the led? Which components does it
            depend on? What information does it need?
            <br/>
            NB: The Led is an output warning device, which is responsible for giving
            real-time information about the state of the transport trolley,
            and therefore it needs to access its data.

            <problem>Track Trolley State</problem>
            <b>Problem</b>: How do we keep track of the trolley state?
            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>: separate the trolley state from the led, make the
                <ksi>trolley state COAP observable</ksi> and use an actor
                to keep track of the current state of the Transport Trolley: <ks><code>trolleystateprovider</code></ks>.

                <b>Reasons</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Making the trolley state COAP observable could facilitate the
                        the implementation of the last requirement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        separating the 2 components makes sense, since they could be
                        located in different contexts and therefore in different nodes;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        separating the 2 states makes the system more modular and ease
                        the extension through new features;
                    </li>
