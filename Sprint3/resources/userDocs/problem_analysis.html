            Even though the GUI needs to receive information about the Led, <b><i>it doesn't need to
            interact directly with the Raspberry Pi</i></b>, since the Led state is provided by
            the WasteService Core.
            For this reason, during this Sprint we're going to focus our attention on the
            WasteService Core project.

            The Sprint 3 software will be the product of the analysis of problems
            related to the WasteServiceStatusGUI.

            <problem>Where to place the WasteServiceStatusGUI node</problem>
            
            <consideration>
                <b>Consideration</b>:
                From the requirements it's clear that the WasteServiceStatusGUI will be
                used by a human operator: the service manager.
            </consideration>

            <solution>
                Since the main purpose of the GUI will be the monitoring of the
                system, it makes sense to arrange that component to be <b><i>as independent as possible</i></b>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Solution</b>:
                A possible solution could be to place the GUI software on a <ksi>separated
                logical context</ksi>, and create a <ksi>controller</ksi> that acts as middleware between
                the WasteService and the GUI (possibly to be implemented as a QAK actor).
            </solution>

            <h3 id="GUI-Components">GUI Components</h3>
            We have to decide what exactly and how to display the information about the 
            3 different components:
            <ul>
                <li>WasteService;</li>
                <li>TransportTrolley;</li>
                <li>Led.</li>
            </ul> 

            <problem>WasteService component</problem>
            <b>Problem</b>: how do we represent the GUI component for the WasteService?
            What information do we have to include? How do we represent them?

            <consideration>
                <b>Consideration</b>:
                The requirement states that the customer is interested in the information
                about the two container.
            </consideration>

            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>:
                For simplicity we are going to consider <ksi>only the two containers</ksi>
                plastic and glass, even though the MapEditor allows to define areas
                for different types of waste.
                <br/>
                To represent those data, we'll be using <ksi>two <code>Double</code> variables</ksi> and
                some GUI elements to make it nicer.
            </solution>

            <problem>TransportTrolley state representation</problem>
            <b>Problem</b>: how do we represent the GUI component for the TransportTrolley?
            What information do we have to include? How do we represent them?
            <consideration>
                <b>Considerations</b>:
                The requirements include both the TransportTrolley state and Led state,
                which means that they're probably made for (at least in part) different information.
                From our point of view the TransportTrolley can be in many different states and
                positions, while the Led just has to display a <i>subset</i> of its states.
            </consideration>
            
            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>:
                to represent the TransportTrolley state, we'll use <ksi>the state our system
                already keeps about the trolley</ksi> (<code>HOME</code>, <code>MOVING</code>,
                <code>PICKUP</code>, <code>DUMP</code>, <code>STOPPED</code>).
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <b>Reasons</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>it's a simple and effective representation;</li>
                    <li>
                        it doesn't requiree any "additional implementation"
                        since our system already supports it.
                    </li>
                </ul> 
            </solution>

            <problem>TransportTrolley position representation</problem>
            <consideration>
                The requirements say that the GUI should display the TransportTrolley state,
                <b><i>but also it's position in the room</i></b>. Therefore, it's state or what it's currently
                doing probably is not enough and we have to provide further information.
            </consideration>

            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>:
                to represent the TransportTrolley position, we'll keep track of its current
                position inside the room (which is going to be a pair of integers, due to
                the fact that the TransportTrolley moves by steps) by using a <ksi>cartesian coordinate system</ksi>, 
                and update the GUI each time the trolley performs a step.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>Reasons</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        the TransportTrolley (actually the PathExecutorBCR) already knows the robot
                        precise location inside the room, since our planner uses its coordinates to
                        calculate the best path. Therefore it doesn't require any "additional implementation";
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        this allows to show an exact and reliable representation (both useful for the monitoring
                        purpose and better from a "design point of view") of the actual position of the trolley;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        it also opens up to many possible extension (interactions, animations, etc. ).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </solution>

            <alternative>
                <b>Alternative</b>: to use a simple descriptive model
                (e.g. "<code>TransportTrolley at Home</code>", "<code>TransportTrolley at Indoor</code>", "<code>TransportTrolley at GlassBox</code>", etc. ).
            </alternative>

            <problem>Led component</problem>
            <b>Problem</b>: how do we represent the GUI component for the Led?
            What information do we have to include? How do we represent them?
            
            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>:
                as per the TransportTrolley state, we do the same for the Led.
                We can adopt the same <ksi>descriptive model</ksi> (3 states: "<code>OFF</code>", "<code>ON</code>", "<code>BLINKING</code>").
                <br/><br/>
                <b>Reasons</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        it doesn't require any "additional implementation", since we can use
                        the function <code>getLedStateFromTrolleyState(state): LedState</code>
                        (implemented during the Sprint2) to get obtain the <code>LedState</code>
                        corresponding to a specific <code>TransportTrolleyState</code>;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        it's simple and effective;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        we could easily map those labels to a graphical component
                        that simulates a Led.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </solution>

            <problem>Data source</problem>
            <b>Problem</b>: where do we retrieve the information for the GUI components?

            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        retrieve the WasteService containers information from the <ksi>WasteService 
                        QAK actor</ksi>, since it keeps track of the deposit requests and updates
                        the system storage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        retrieve the TransportTrolley position information from the <ksi>PathExecutorBCR QAK actor</ksi>,
                        since it keeps track of its location inside the room.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        retrieve the TransportTrolley state and the Led state information from the
                        <ksi>TrolleyStateProvider QAK actor</ksi>, since it keeps track of the trolley current
                        state (CoAP).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </solution>

            <problem>When to exchange data</problem>
            <b>Problem</b>: when does the controller have to send updates to the GUI?
            How frequently?

            <solution>
                <b>Solution</b>:
                we send the GUI updates <ksi>as soon as possible</ksi> (when the controller receives
                any update from the WasteService components, it immediately sends an updated
                version of the status information to the GUI).
                <br/><br/>
                <b>Reasons</b>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        some information, such as the TransportTrolley position, or
                        the Led state are extremely time-dependent, and the validity of the information
                        they carry could be lost if we wait before sending them;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        since the Led
                        state is used as an alarm indicator, it could be associated with an emergency
                        situation, which obviously needs to be solved quickly otherwise could lead to
                        unknown consequences.

            <alternative>
                <b>Alternative</b>: another possibility would be to buffer the status changes
                and send them in batches.

                    <li>
                        <b>Compatibility</b>: websites are more compatible with a wide range of devices
                        and platforms than mobile apps. A website can be accessed from any device
                        with a web browser, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones;

                        <b>Maintenance</b>: websites require less maintenance than mobile apps. When updates
                        or changes need to be made, they can be made to the website and will be immediately 
                        accessible to all users. With mobile apps, updates must be made to the app and users 
                        must download the updated version to see the changes;
                    </li>
                    <li>

            What format will be data transferred as? Is there any suitable protocol?
            
            <solution>
                <b>Possible solution</b>:
                we could use <ksi>CoAP</ksi>, and make the status controller CoAP observable
                (or the single resources).
                This way the GUI could observe it and get updated immediately each time
                a change occurs.

                    <li>CoAP is already highly supported by QAK;</li>
                    <li>

                MQTT could also be a valid protocol to exchange data, since it would be trivial to
                provide a topic for each resource (containers, trolley, led) and make the GUI
                subscribe to them.
