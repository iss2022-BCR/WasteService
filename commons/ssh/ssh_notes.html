            <h2 id="SSH-Password-less">SSH Password-less</h2>
            A possible way to setup ssh communication with a node,
            is by using SSH public key authentication.
            
            <h3 id="Advantages">Advantages</h3>
            There are several reasons for using SSH password-less authentication, including:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Increased Security</b>: passwords can be guessed or intercepted by malicious actors,
                    whereas password-less authentication using public and private keys offers a more
                    secure method of authentication. With password-less authentication, there is no need
                    to store sensitive login information on a remote server, reducing the risk of potential data breaches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Convenience</b>: with password-less authentication, users can log in to remote servers without
                    having to enter a password every time. This saves time and eliminates the need to remember
                    complex passwords, making the authentication process more convenient and user-friendly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Automation</b>: password-less authentication can be used to automate tasks and scripts that
                    require authentication, making it easier to manage and maintain large-scale infrastructure.
                    This can save time and reduce the risk of human error when performing routine tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Centralized Management</b>: public and private keys can be easily managed from a central location,
                    making it easier to control access to remote servers. This makes it easier to revoke access for
                    users who no longer require it or to add new users as needed.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3 id="Ed25519-Public-key-Algorithm">Ed25519 Public-key Algorithm</h3>

            When it comes to cryptographic algorithms, <b>RSA</b> is a popular choice, but compared to newer algorithms,
            it can be <i>slow</i>. In situations where time is a critical factor, such as with embedded systems, a faster
            algorithm is essential.

            <b>Ed25519</b> is a relatively new public-key algorithm that is becoming increasingly popular for SSH key
            generation due to its unique features and advantages over other algorithms such as RSA and DSA.
            Its main advantages are: 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Strong Security: Ed25519 is designed to be very secure and resistant to various attacks,
                    including side-channel attacks and collision attacks. It has been shown to be resistant
                    to all known attacks, making it a very safe option for SSH key generation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Speed: generating and using Ed25519 SSH keys requires less computational resources and
                    can perform faster than other algorithms like RSA or DSA.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Short Key Length: Ed25519 keys are shorter than other public-key algorithms, which makes
                    them easier to manage and store. For example, a 256-bit Ed25519 key is as secure as a
                    3072-bit RSA key or a 3072-bit DSA key.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Standardized and widely supported: Ed25519 is standardized and supported by most modern
                    operating systems and SSH clients. It has become a popular choice for SSH key generation,
                    and many organizations have started to adopt it as their default algorithm.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Future-proof: Ed25519 has a long projected lifespan, and it is unlikely to be broken by
                    future advances in cryptography. This means that Ed25519 keys are expected to remain secure
                    and usable for many years to come.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Generate key on device</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Open your terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:
<pre>
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The command will prompt you to enter a file name to save the key.
                    You can either accept the default file name or enter a custom one.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next, the command will prompt you to enter a passphrase. This is
                    optional but highly recommended, as it adds an extra layer of security to your key.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once you have entered the passphrase (if desired), the key will be generated
                    and saved in the specified file location.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Adding the Ed25519 Key to the Raspberry Pi</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Navigate to your home directory and create a new file called authorized_keys
                    if it doesn't already exist:
<pre>
mkdir ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Open the `authorized_keys` file with a text editor and paste the contents
                    of your Ed25519 public key (located in the `.pub` file that was generated
                    when you created the key) into a new line in the file.
                    <br/>
                    Save and close the `authorized_keys` file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, to confirm that the key has been added successfully, try logging
                    in to the Raspberry Pi again using your new Ed25519 key:
<pre>
ssh pi@&lt;raspberry-ip&gt;
</pre>
                </li>
            </ol>
